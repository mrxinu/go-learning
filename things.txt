Dont create alias's for builtin types unless they are for something new.
For example, don't do 
    type counter int
counter should rather be an argument in a function with the name counter and of type int.
example
    type time int64
is ok since it doesn't represent an int64 but nanoseconds, and it also have methods
to work with that value of nanoseconds.
